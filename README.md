# Titanic Survival Prediction – Logistic Regression (CIS 412)

This project applies data preprocessing and machine learning to predict passenger survival on the Titanic dataset. Built as part of the Software Lab for CIS 412 – Business Machine Learning.

## 📊 Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- Loaded and explored the Titanic dataset (`titanic.csv`) for feature engineering and missing value imputation.
- Applied one-hot encoding to categorical features (e.g., Sex, Embarked).
- Built a **logistic regression model** to classify survival outcomes.
- Evaluated performance using confusion matrix, accuracy, and precision/recall metrics.
- Visualized key trends and correlations between features and survival likelihood.
